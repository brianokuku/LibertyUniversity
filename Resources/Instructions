Instructions on installing the Application: (Assignment 1)

1. The app was made using Angular 4. After downloading it from the github link sent in the email,
you have to download the modules using npm. It will automatically download the proper modules based on package-json
2. Call ng serve using the terminal and the app should run on localhost:4200
3. This app did not make use of a state manager

I have attached screen shots of the app showing what it should look like after installing it.
